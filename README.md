This is a simple program written in Python using Pillow for image manipulation and tkinter for GUI. ChatGPT was used heavily to put it together, using GPT4-o.

There is a build for Windows availalbie in releases. You can run this on any platform that supports Python by cloning this repo. You'll need to make sure you have Pillow and tkinter.

Known issues:
*Math for adding letterboxes/pillarboxes to pictures for Instagram doesn't work properly on wide images. Only use it on images that are taller than the target aspect ratio
*Codebase is horrific. Believe me when I say all the bad ideas were mine and not ChatGPT's. However, it works and the outputs are quality which is really all that matters to me

To-Do
*Fix Instagram aspect ratio math
*Combine 'social media scalers' into one script
